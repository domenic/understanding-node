# Course Description

Node.js is an exciting new platform for building web applications in JavaScript. With its unique I/O model, it excels at the sort of scalable and real-time situations we are increasingly demanding of our servers. And the ability to use JavaScript for both the client and server opens up many possibilities for code sharing, expertise reuse, and rapid development.

This class is intended for those with some basic knowledge of JavaScript, interested in an introduction to the Node.js ecosystem and development platform. We'll discuss how to get started with Node, and why you would want to. We'll then explore Node's module and package system, demononstrating several of the more popular and impressive packages that exemplify the type of tasks Node excels at. These include low-level HTTP streaming with the http module, high-level bidirectional websocket communication with socket.io, and server-browser code sharing with browserify, jsdom, and node-canvas.
